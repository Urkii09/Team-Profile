      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h4>What is Cryptocurrency.</h4>
      <p>Cryptocurrency is a way to trade currency and other assets digitally, independent of any third-party entity, such as a government or bank. These transactions take place on a decentralised ledger system called the blockchain. The first crypto was Bitcoin, and it remains a leading digital currency, along with Ethereum, XRP, and others.<br />
        Additionally, cryptocurrencies are frequently used to facilitate grey and black-market transactions, so many countries view them with distrust or outright animosity.</p>
      <h4>What is Blockchain.</h4>
      <p>A cryptocurrency’s blockchain is the master public ledger that records and stores all prior transactions and activity, validating ownership of all units of the currency at any given point in time. As the record of a cryptocurrency’s entire transaction history to date, a blockchain has a finite length — containing a finite number of transactions — that increases over time. Identical copies of the blockchain are stored in every node of the cryptocurrency’s software network — the network of decentralized server farms, run by computer-savvy individuals or groups of individuals known as miners, that continually record and authenticate cryptocurrency transactions.<br />
        A cryptocurrency transaction technically isn’t finalized until it’s added to the blockchain, which usually occurs within minutes. Once the transaction is finalized, it’s usually irreversible. Unlike traditional payment processors, such as PayPal and credit cards, most cryptocurrencies have no built-in refund or chargeback functions, although some newer cryptocurrencies have rudimentary refund features. During the lag time between the transaction’s initiation and finalization, the units aren’t available for use by either party. Instead, they’re held in a sort of escrow — limbo, for all intents and purposes.<br />
        The blockchain thus prevents double-spending, or the manipulation of cryptocurrency code to allow the same currency units to be duplicated and sent to multiple recipients.</p>
      <h2>State of the Technology</h2>
      <p>As of April 2021, there are over 10,000 different types of cryptocurrencies. The different types of crypto generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coins, which can include Bitcoin and altcoins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies)</li>
        <li>Tokens</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Crypto Tokens vs. Coins</h3>
      <p>Encrypted coins and tokens can fall under the heading of crypto. And, generally, they can be listed into two sorts of cryptocurrency: alternative cryptocurrency coins (Altcoins) or tokens. </p>
      <h4>Alternative Cryptocurrency Coins (Altcoins)</h4>
      <p>Altcoins usually refer to any coins that are not Bitcoins. Bitcoin is a popular digital currency that’s produced by computational solutions to complicated math problems. It works separately from a central bank or state entity (i.e., government-backed Treasury).</p>
       
      <p>Some altcoins include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Peercoin</li>
        <li>Litecoin</li>
        <li>Dogecoin</li>
        <li>Auroracoin</li>
        <li>Namecoin</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>In fact, the name “altcoin” actually means “alternative to Bitcoin.” Namecoin is considered the very first altcoin, created in 2011.</p>
      <p>Like Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies listed here have a limited supply of coins—to keep the balance in check and to reinforce its perceived value. There is a fixed number of Bitcoins that can exist—21 million, as decided by the creator/s of Bitcoin, though some remain to be mined. Once all 21 million are tapped (the number changes when new blocks are mined), that’s it. The only way to bring in more is for Bitcoin’s protocol to allow for it. <br />
        Though most altcoins are built upon the same basic framework as Bitcoin, many claim to be better versions of Bitcoin.<br />
        Each system can differ from the next, as they’re created to serve various purposes and applications, and identified in different ways. <br />
        Some coins don’t work with the same open-source protocol that Bitcoin does, however. For example, the following list of cryptocurrencies have created their own separate systems and protocols: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethereum</li>
        <li>Ripple</li>
        <li>Omni</li>
        <li>NNXT</li>
        <li>Waves</li>
        <li>Counterparty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They’re each self-supporting, too. </p>
      <h4>Tokens </h4>
      <p>Unlike altcoins, tokens are created and given out through an Initial Coin Offering, or ICO, very much like a stock offering. They can be represented as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Value tokens (Bitcoins)</li>
        <li>Security tokens (to protect your account)</li>
        <li>Utility tokens (designated for specific uses)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They are not so much meant to be used as money as they are used to describe a function. Like American dollars, they represent value, but they are not in themselves of value. Tokens are a type of encryption, specifically referring to the long lines of numbers and letters representing the crypto used in a transaction, such as a money transfer or bill payment. In short, tokens cover a number of meanings. <br />
        For instance, both Bitcoin and Ether (from Ethereum) are considered crypto tokens. </p>
      <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
      <p>Throughout the past decade or so, there has been an increase in the popularity of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency stored in electronic wallets, which is transferred and recorded using blockchain technology. A blockchain consists of a chain of several blocks, each block being a piece of data stored in a database known as the chain.   Cryptocurrency may seem like a technology of the future, but it has, and will, revolutionize the way we store money, pay for goods and services, and do business. Additionally, there are other ways that cryptocurrency can make our economy and society a better place by making transactions more private and efficient and improving the e-commerce system. The idea of an implementing a digital currency into our society is exciting, our society has never before had the opportunity to make international cashless transactions not just the economy will benefit from this but also the social constructs of our society by letting still developing countries have the same benefits and economic advantages as other more technologically advanced countries.</p>
      <p>While the nature of cryptocurrency is still somewhat ambiguous, it has caught the attention of many as the market and applications for cryptocurrency continue to grow. Perhaps one of the greatest indicators of cryptocurrency’s success is exemplified through an article written by Yessi Bello Perez, which entails the story of a man who in 2010 bought a few pizzas for the price of ten thousand bitcoins. Perez explains that in 2018, those bitcoins were worth 82 million dollars, roughly $4 million per slice (Perez, 2019). In 2010, it was interesting to see that you could buy something with lines of code on a screen but to see that only five years later, those ten thousand bitcoins would now be worth millions displays the intensity of the growth of cryptocurrency throughout the past few years. While some are still hesitant to accept digital currency as a universal currency system, its increase in popularity leaves many economists and small investors wondering how the implementation of cryptocurrency in our society will impact the global economy.</p>
      <p>Initially, blockchain technology was created by Nakamoto as a way to store bitcoin. But eventually, blockchain and bitcoin separated when people found a use for blockchain outside of bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Even today, there are still those who cannot distinguish between blockchain and bitcoin. But it wasn’t until 2014 that people started to explore how blockchain technology could be altered to perform many different kinds of operations. Using blockchain technology is extremely efficient and may even reduce the cost of transactions.</p>
      <p>Ethereum is different from bitcoin because Ethereum can record other transactions such as loans or contracts, transactions that bitcoin cannot record. Ethereum began in 2015 and is used to develop smart contracts, which can be automatically processed based on a set of conditions established in the blockchain. Ethereum caught the attention of multiple corporations such as Microsoft, BBVA, and USB. These corporations were attracted to the functionality of these smart contracts and by the potential to save money and time.</p>
      <p>Like most new technologies, cryptocurrency has benefits and drawbacks. Cryptocurrency’s ability to let users make transactions amongst themselves without supervision and verification from a third party has left many worried about the doors this may open if cryptocurrency ended up in the wrong hands, most notably by Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, who was sceptical of cryptocurrency and its ability to make crime easier. Bill Gates was concerned that blockchain technology was killing people by revolutionizing financial crime, terrorism, and drug dealing, by saying in early 2018, “The main feature of cryptocurrencies is their anonymity. I don’t think this is a good thing. The Government’s ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now, cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs, so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way” (Gates, 2018). Gates’ main concern with cryptocurrency is that the lack of a third-party intermediary might allow a way to short the government’s intervention in illegal activity. Cryptocurrency provides secure and private peer-to-peer transactions, and these privative transactions can be used both lawfully and for illicit purposes. Naturally, there are some concerns raised that cryptocurrency creates new opportunities for offenders to conduct illegal activity like exchanging illegal substances, laundering money, and terrorist funding.</p>
      <p>Another drawback to cryptocurrency is the instability of the market. Right now, the market for most cryptocurrencies is unstable, meaning that the values are constantly fluctuating, sometimes by wide margins. Because of this, some people have made a lot of money when the price of cryptocurrency drastically increased. But this also means that others might lose just as much money in the same amount of time if the price cryptocurrency crashes. With that being said, it is not likely that that market will continue like this for much longer, as cryptocurrency’s popularity continues to increase and more and more people buy it, the market will likely stabilize. There have been theories that the initial volatility of the values of some of the common cryptocurrencies is merely just stress testing and that over time, the fluctuations will level out, and the now unstable cryptocurrencies will soon have stable values.</p>
      <p>If crypto currency is handled correctly with the security of Blockchain, it will inevitably remove the need for financial institutions unless they get on board and accept Crypto Currency as a legitimate form of money.</p>
